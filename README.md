## Friday Ruby test

A test to revisit the basics of Ruby. There are 41 questions to test Ruby knowldege.

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual
